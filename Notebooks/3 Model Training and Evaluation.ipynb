    "The first two layers will have 256 nodes. The activation function we will be using for our first 2 layers is the `ReLU`, or `Rectified Linear Activation`. This activation function has been proven to work well in neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also apply a `Dropout` value of 50% on our first two layers. This will randomly exclude nodes from each update cycle which in turn results in a network that is capable of better generalisation and is less likely to overfit the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our output layer will have 10 nodes (num_labels) which matches the number of possible classifications. The activation is for our output layer is `softmax`. Softmax makes the output sum up to 1 so the output can be interpreted as probabilities. The model will then make its prediction based on which option has the highest probability."
